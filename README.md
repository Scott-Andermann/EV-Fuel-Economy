MBA project where we used various machine learning models on that were trained of data sourced from www.fueleconomy.gov.

The purpose of the project was to build a model that an OEM could use to understand the fuel efficiency reuqirements of
the market and extrapolate those demands into the mid-size pickup segment.

This project required gathering data from an external source, filtering, structuring, and cleaning the data to remove outliers and
un-needed data, exploring the data to understand the current state, and finally building and evaluating various machine learning models.

The analysis, completed in Spring 2021, showed that a fuel efficiency rating of 80MPGe and a pricing premium of $7,000 compared to a similar gasoline pickup.
With the launch of the 2022 F150 Lightning the analysis proved to align closely with the specs of the F150 Lightning.  The gasoline F150 starts at $31,000 with 
the EV model starting at $39,000 for a delta of $8,000 and a combined MPGe of 70MPGe.
